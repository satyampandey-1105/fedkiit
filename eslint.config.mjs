     * `src/**` is the 1:1 port of FED-Frontend. Its components keep the original
     * markup and logic on purpose — that fidelity is the whole point of the
     * migration, and it is what makes the replica pixel-identical.
     *
     * The rules below are React-Compiler-era lint rules that postdate the
     * original code. They flag *how it was written*, not anything broken:
     * `setState` inside an effect, mutation of a value captured in render, and
     * components declared inside other components. Satisfying them would mean
     * rewriting the state flow of ~120 components with no behavioural change
     * intended — a large, untestable diff against a working UI.
     *
     * They are therefore warnings here, so they stay visible without failing
     * the lint run, while everything under app/, lib/, components/ and
     * scripts/ (code written for this project) is still held to `error`.
     *
     * Genuine defects found by these rules were fixed rather than downgraded:
     * an undefined `<Outlet />` left behind by the router codemod, and eight
     * unescaped entities.
